# Game Discovery Lens

**Discover your next game. Research the games behind your next idea.**

Game Discovery Lens is a bilingual game-discovery portfolio application built with React, TypeScript, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL. It demonstrates reliable software behavior through account-owned collections, explicit persistence modes, recoverable failures, and an optional AI search provider.

The project began as group coursework using Java Swing and SQL Server. The modern web application is a subsequent refactor; the original implementation remains in the repository as project history. The modern app runs independently of the original school database.

The portfolio was renamed from ArcadeIQ to Game Discovery Lens. Historical verification records retain the names and configuration identifiers used when those checks were captured.

Read the [engineering case study](docs/case-study.md) for the problems, decisions, verification evidence, and remaining limits behind the refactor.

## Two Ways to Explore

The homepage offers player and developer entry points. Each opens a distinct browsing experience before the user starts a search.

| Player discovery | Developer research |
| --- | --- |
| Illustrated recommendations, a featured game, price/rating signals, and saved favorites. | A catalog overview, frequent tags, research references, and selected-game opportunity insights. |
| Recommendations use catalog rating and review count with stable tie-breaking. | Overview statistics describe the loaded catalog; ownership and revenue estimates are labelled. |
| Search by title, genre, budget, or natural-language conditions. | Drill into a tag or search and sort games for comparison. |

These are viewing perspectives, independent of account permissions. Both support collections and return to the homepage to choose another perspective.

Screenshots show the fixed-data demo. The dark gaming interface includes locally bundled game artwork, responsive layouts, and an English/Chinese switch that preserves the current page state. Game names, user-created collection names, and external provider text remain unchanged. See [artwork sources](docs/verification/game-artwork-sources.md) and the [bilingual behavior](frontend/README.md#english-and-chinese).

## Run the Demo

Use Node.js 20, matching CI. From the repository root:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5173
```

Open [Game Discovery Lens demo](http://127.0.0.1:5173/?mode=demo). No database or AI key is required.

| Mode | Catalog and search | Collections |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `?mode=demo` | Bundled sample catalog and local rules; no backend requests. | Saved in this browser only. |
| `?mode=api` | FastAPI/PostgreSQL and the configured search provider. | Saved to the signed-in account. |

The header identifies the active mode. An API failure remains visible with recovery controls; it never becomes a sample result or a browser-only save. Demo and account collections are separate.

## Run with the API

Start PostgreSQL and the backend with Docker, then migrate and seed the local database. Run these commands from the repository root while the frontend remains open in another terminal:

```powershell
docker compose up -d postgres backend
docker compose exec backend alembic upgrade head
docker compose exec backend python -m app.scripts.seed
```

Open [API mode](http://127.0.0.1:5173/?mode=api), choose a perspective, and register or sign in to save games. API documentation is available at [localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs). For an existing local PostgreSQL installation, use the [native Python setup](backend/README.md#local-postgresql--python-virtual-environment).

The frontend defaults to `http://localhost:8000/api`. To change it, copy `frontend/.env.example` to `frontend/.env.local` and set `VITE_API_BASE_URL`; restart Vite afterward. The URL's `mode` overrides `VITE_DATA_MODE`. Backend settings belong in the repository root `.env`; for a different frontend host or port, include its exact origin in `GDL_CORS_ORIGINS`. See the [frontend](frontend/README.md) and [backend](backend/README.md) configuration guides.

## Engineering Focus

- **Account ownership:** collection and saved-game routes derive the owner from a signed bearer token. Missing or expired sessions are rejected, and another account's collections are hidden.
- **Persistence and recovery:** loading, mutations, retries, and account changes have explicit states. Failed requests do not change storage modes or report a successful save.
- **Concurrent requests:** an older search, game insight, or account response cannot replace a newer selection or session.
- **Search consistency:** literal title search combines with price, tag, and review filters. Frontend rules and PostgreSQL search tests share `tests/fixtures/search-contract.json`.
- **Clear module boundaries:** page composition, discovery, selected-game details, account/collection state, and API/demo adapters have separate responsibilities.
- **Reproducible verification:** unit and UI tests, isolated PostgreSQL integration tests, TypeScript/build checks, and a GitHub Actions workflow accompany the implementation.

## AI Behavior and Boundaries

Natural-language search supports a local rules parser and an optional DeepSeek provider. Provider output is normalized into the same search contract, with recognized product price/rating/review conditions enforced in code; PostgreSQL executes the resulting filters and ranking. Free games have a zero-price ceiling, `cheap` defaults to US$35 unless a budget is specified, and `highly rated` requires a rating of at least 4.4 and a positive review count. Known and quoted titles are separated from those conditions. Search responses identify their source as `rules` or `deepseek`. Configured fallback returns rules results when the provider fails; disabling fallback exposes the provider error.

Game and collection insight text currently uses catalog metadata and aggregate statistics. It is not a summary of review source text, and recommendations are not personalized or live-trending claims. Source labels and estimate notes stay visible. The Chinese interface translates recognized sample/rule content and preserves unrecognized provider text with an original-content note.

See the [optional provider configuration](backend/README.md#optional-ai-provider). Provider keys stay in backend environment variables, never in `VITE_*` variables or Git. The preserved [first live evaluation](docs/verification/ai-evaluation-2026-09-15.md) found 24/31 DeepSeek integration cases meeting both intent and ordered-result expectations. After the contract fixes, a [new live pass](docs/verification/search-fixes-2026-09-16.md) met both in 31/31 on the same queries, with no observed fallbacks. These are application-integration results, including deterministic constraints, not raw model accuracy. Eight independently formulated follow-up queries have a separately documented fixture correction and offline rescore; broader held-out evaluation and traceable review evidence remain future work.

## Verification

Frontend tests and production build, from `frontend/`:

```powershell
npm test
npm run build
```

Backend tests, from the repository root using Python 3.10 or newer:

```powershell
python -m pip install -r backend/requirements-dev.txt
python -m unittest discover -s backend/tests -t backend
```

To include PostgreSQL persistence, ownership, and search checks, set a local test database URL before running the same backend command:

```powershell
$env:GDL_TEST_DATABASE_URL="postgresql+psycopg://gdl:gdl_dev_password@localhost:5432/gdl"
python -m unittest discover -s backend/tests -t backend
```

Each database suite creates and removes only its own UUID-named schema. Existing application tables are not used. Without the explicit URL, database tests are skipped. Provider responses are controlled in automated AI tests; the suite does not call a paid provider. [GitHub Actions](.github/workflows/ci.yml) configures PostgreSQL for the backend tests and runs the frontend tests and build.

## Repository Guide

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `frontend/` | Current React/TypeScript application, API/demo adapters, and UI tests. |
| `backend/` | FastAPI routes, SQLAlchemy models, Alembic migrations, and backend tests. |
| `tests/fixtures/` | Shared search contract and an independent synthetic boundary catalog for evaluation. |
| `docs/` | Architecture, setup guides, verification records, and screenshots. |
| `scripts/` | Local frontend, backend, and database setup helpers. |
| `UI/`, `migrations/`, `Views/` | Original Java Swing/SQL Server application and database logic. |
| `PopulationScripts/`, `WebScrape/`, `data/` | Legacy CSV ingestion, scraping utilities, and seed data. |
| `demo/` | Earlier static prototype retained for reference. |

Read the [architecture guide](docs/architecture.md) for the current module and data flow. The modern application uses PostgreSQL; SQL Server stored procedures, transactions, Java Swing, and bcrypt belong to the legacy implementation. The modern API uses PBKDF2 password hashing and signed bearer tokens.

The retained coursework includes marketplace workflows such as purchasing, reviews, bundles, vouchers, and folders. These are historical features, not claims about the current web interface. See the [SQL Server setup](docs/local-sqlserver-setup.md), [legacy migrations](migrations/README.md), and [migration plan](docs/migration-plan.md).

Game Discovery Lens is a portfolio application. Further work centers on traceable AI evidence and evaluated provider behavior; a public production deployment is outside the current demonstration scope.
